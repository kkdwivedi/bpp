bpp - C preprocessor based site generator
-----------------------------------------

To use, simply clone the repository, and start authoring files in it directly.
Look at example.bpp for an example on how to write entries (and define your own
widgets). Macros using @@str@@ in their expansion will automatically quote
their arguments.

Yes, abusing the C preprocessor for this was probably not a great idea, but
it's too late.
